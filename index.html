&nbsp;Start from 1989 since world wide web was first invented,</br>
internet have thoroughly changed the way people live.</br>
As a student who was grown up in an age of rapid internet development,</br>
I am keenly aware of the convenience of internet. Therefore,</br>
I started to take computer science course in my high school in New Jersey.</br>
&nbsp;After I experienced how powerful and marvelous computer science was, </br>
I decided to take that as my major in Stony Brook University and</br>
continue to achieve deeper knowledge. As I am going to graduate,</br>
the most attractive topic to me are cloud computing, internet and security.</br>
In the future, I hope I can go further and further in computer science and</br>
involve myself in the leading-edge knowledge of computer science.</br>
